# 🧠 BioPlay: Interactive Biomechanics Learning Platform

**BioPlay** is an interactive educational web platform designed to make the complex science of biomechanics simple, visual, and engaging for students and enthusiasts.  
Through a blend of simulations, structured learning paths, quizzes, progress tracking, and community collaboration, **BioPlay** turns traditional textbook learning into an immersive experience.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Biomechanics can often feel abstract — full of equations, diagrams, and theories that are hard to visualize.  
**BioPlay** bridges that gap with **interactive simulations** and **real-time calculations** that help users connect physical movement with underlying biomechanical principles.

Users can explore:
- How joint angles and external loads affect muscle forces and joint torques.
- Real-world applications of Newton’s Laws in human movement.
- The role of different muscles during basic limb movements.

The platform is fully browser-based — no downloads required — and accessible for students, educators, and self-learners.

## 🦴 3D Visualization & Blender Integration

We used **Blender** to create and animate a 3D skeletal model for visualizing joint movement and muscle actions.  
This helped prototype the biomechanics behind joint torques and inspired the simulation's logic and layout.
